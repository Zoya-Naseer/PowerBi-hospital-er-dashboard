# 🏥 Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard  

## 📌 Introduction  
This project focuses on analyzing **hospital emergency room (ER) performance** using **Power BI**.  
The dashboard provides **data-driven insights** into patient flow, wait times, bed occupancy, and staff utilization to help hospital management improve decision-making and operational efficiency.  

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement  
Hospitals face major challenges in emergency room operations, such as:  
- Long patient wait times  
- Overcrowding and bed shortages  
- Inefficient staff and resource allocation  
- Lack of visibility into patient journey and critical bottlenecks  

This project aims to tackle these issues by providing **visual analytics and actionable recommendations**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives & KPIs  
The dashboard tracks key metrics to measure ER performance, including:  
- **Patient Volume** – Monthly, daily, and shift-based inflow/outflow  
- **Average Waiting Time** – By month, day, and severity level  
- **Bed Occupancy Rate** – Utilization vs availability  
- **Doctor & Nurse Utilization** – Workload distribution  
- **Patient Journey Analysis** – Admission → Treatment → Discharge  

---

## 🛠️ Approach & Methodology  
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Preparing raw hospital ER data  
2. **Data Modeling** – Star schema designed in Power BI  
3. **DAX Calculations** – KPIs for waiting time, occupancy, staff load  
4. **Dashboard Design** – Page-wise professional dashboards with insights  
5. **Business Recommendations** – Improvement strategies for management
